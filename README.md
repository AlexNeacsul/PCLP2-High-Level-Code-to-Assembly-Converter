# PCLP2 High-Level Code to Assembly Converter
This project is a simple compiler-like tool that converts high-level code statements into equivalent assembly instructions. The tool focuses on parsing basic assignments, arithmetic operations, and variable handling, helping users understand how high-level programming constructs are represented at the machine level.
